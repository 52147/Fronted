# Promise
- Promise is the new technique of ES6 for asynchronous development.
- Promise is a constructor.
- Promise is used to encapsulate async function that can recieve tht result of success or fail.
- Javascript object is based on constructor and prototype instead of class. JS can use constructor to initialize object.

```javascript
        // Vehicle is constuctor
        var Vehicle = function () {
            this.price = 1000;
        }
        var v = new Vehicle();
        v.price // 1000

```
